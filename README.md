# Chat Like an Egyptian

Chat Like an Egyptian is a web experiment to investigate the possible adoption of Emoji-based communication instead of a script-based one. Emoji are ubiquitous in messaging and are used as a way of expressing emotion and concepts. We are inspired in this paper by the apparent similarity between emoji and Egyptian hieroglyphs as a sort of a return to a primitive, but perhaps a more effective form of writing. We developed a web application that lets the two users join a chatroom and communicate exclusively through emoji. The results from 14 participants are analyzed from multiple perspectives: effectiveness, fun, and cultural relevance. In conclusion, we discuss how the emoji-based experience fares, possible improvement, and future research.
